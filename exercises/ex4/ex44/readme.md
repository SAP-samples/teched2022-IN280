# Exercise 4.4 - Understand how the health rating of a service is calculated

This exercise serves for your understanding how the rating of a tenant's health is calculated in the Health Monitoring use case of SAP Cloud ALM. It is only optional and if you want to perform only necessary steps you can jump directly to [Get an overview on monitored metrics of a Cloud Integration service](/exercises/ex4/ex45).

The technical metrics from a monitored services can be used to calculate the overall health of a monitored service. E.g. Cloud Integration is pulled every 5 minutes.

Each service type offers its own metrics and ratings to Cloud ALM. 
<br>E.g. Cloud Integration offers exhaustion of JMS resources and expiry of certificates. On the other hand a SAP Integration Business Planning service offers metrics such as Active Users in a ABAP system or Delayed application jobs.

The service health is **calculated bottom up**: each metric, as a specific certificate validity or the activation status of a JMS (Java Messaging Service) queue, gets rated individually. 

Thresholds define when a metric receives a certain rating, such as *OK* or *Critical*. The metric rating is mapped to a metric health score to automate the calculation of the overall serviceâ€™s health score. 

The health score of the overall service is determined by the mean score of all individual metrics. A service health percentage of less than 100% determines a service as in Warning, with less than 80% as in *Critical* state. And as soon as one metric is rated as Fatal the entire service has a health score of 0% and is in *Critical* state.

Some metrics have only **informative** character, such as the total number of messages in a JMS queue. They are not included in the health calculation of a service.

*Example:* A Cloud Integration tenant offers 41 metrics. 3 metrics have only informative values and are not counted. Therefore only 38 are relevant for the calculation.
Sum up 10 metrics in *Critical* state mapped to a score of 0%, 1 in *Warning* 50%, and 27 with *Ok* 100%, the sum is 27,5 divided by 38, and rounded. 
<br>This results to a service health percentage of 72% and the service is rated as *Critical*.

## Summary

Now you understand how the rating of a tenant's health is calculated.

# Understand metric ratings

This section servies for your understanding how the rating of a tenant's health is calculated in the Health Monitoring use case of SAP Cloud ALM.

The technical metrics from a monitored services can be used to calculate the overall health of a monitored service. E.g. Cloud Integration is pulled every 5 minutes.

Each service type offers its own metrics and ratings to Cloud ALM. 
<br>E.g. Cloud Integration offers exhaustion of JMS resources and expiry of certificates. On the other hand a SAP Integration Business Planning service offers metrics such as Active Users in a ABAP system or Delayed application jobs.

The service health is **calculated bottom up**: each metric, as a specific certificate validity or the activation status of a JMS (Java Messaging Service) queue, gets rated individually. 

Thresholds define when a metric receives a certain rating, such as *OK* or *Critical*. The metric rating is mapped to a metric health score to automate the calculation of the overall serviceâ€™s health score. 

The health score of the overall service is determined by the mean score of all individual metrics. A service health percentage of less than 100% determines a service as in Warning, with less than 80% as in *Critical* state. And as soon as one metric is rated as Fatal the entire service has a health score of 0% and is in *Critical* state.

Some metrics have only **informative** character, such as the total number of messages in a JMS queue. They are not included in the health calculation of a service.

*Example:* A Cloud Integration tenant offers 41 metrics. 3 metrics have only informative values and are not counted. Therefore only 38 are relevant for the calculation.
Sum up 10 metrics in *Critical* state mapped to a score of 0%, 1 in *Warning* 50%, and 27 with *Ok* 100%, the sum is 27,5 divided by 38, and rounded. 
<br>This results to a service health percentage of 72% and the service is rated as *Critical*.

# Watch a deployment exception in alerting

In this exercise you will see a deployment exception as an example of an alert in *Integration & Exception Monitoring*.

#### Prerequisites:

- You are logged in to the [SAP Cloud ALM tenant](https://teched22-cloudalm-003.eu10.alm.cloud.sap/launchpad#Shell-home) and have navigated to *Integration & Exception Monitoring*
- *If you are performing all configurations yourself:* Alerting for *Integration Exceptions* should be activated for that Cloud Integration service you have registered: `CloudIntegration-<tenant_name>_<userID>`
    
    In the *preconfigured Cloud Integration service* in SAP Cloud ALM `CloudIntegration-<tenant_name>` the alerting to integration exceptions is already activated and nothing has to be done.
    
- You have provoked a deployment exception in the Cloud Integration capability of SAP Integration Suite

# Exercise 2.3 - Add your email address to SAP Cloud ALM

In this exercise, we will add your email address to SAP Cloud ALM and verify it. Email recipients are relevant whenever you want to get alert notifications in your email inbox or collaborate in a team.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark: In the IN280 exercises you might recognize the email addresses `<userID>@opensapusers.com`. These are no valid email addresses and cannot be used in any of the SAP Cloud ALM actions.  

**After adding you as new recipient others will see your email-address. Please be aware of this!**  :heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark:

# Exercise 1 - Register an self-managed Cloud Integration service in SAP CLoud ALM

In this exercise, we will establish an authenticated connection to a Cloud Integration tenant to get it monitored.

**Note:** This exercise is not necessary to perform the Exercises 2 to 4. It is targeted to those attendees who are interested in understanding how to do all configuration steps such as how to register a new service in SAP Cloud ALM or activate alerts. If you are not interested in you can use a **pre-configured /default *Cloud Integration* service** and can jump directly to [Exercise 2 - Monitoring a deployment exception](/exercises/ex2/README.md)

## Exercise steps

Run through the steps in the given order

1. [Register a Cloud Integration service in LMS](/exercises/ex1/ex11/)
2. [Add an HTTP endpoint to a managed service](/exercises/ex1/ex12/)
3. [Activate data collection for the use case Integration & Exception Monitoring](/exercises/ex1/ex13/)

   For *Health Monitoring* the data collection is activated automatically after the creation of the HTTP endpoint

## Summary

You've now set up an **own-managed *Cloud Integration* service** in LMS with a secure connection to a Cloud Integration tenant in SAP Integration Suite. The service covers all three monitoring use cases integration, exception, and health monitoring.

Next we will get experience with an integration flow that cannot be deployed. Continue to - [Exercise 2 - Monitoring a deployment exception](/exercises/ex2/README.md)

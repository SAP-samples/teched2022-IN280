# Exercise 1 - Configure the monitoring of Cloud Integration in SAP CLoud ALM

In this exercise, we will establish an authenticated connection to a Cloud Integration tenant to get it monitored.

:warning: This exercise is not necessary to perform the Exercises 2 to 4. It is targeted to those attendees you are interested in understanding how to setup an authenticated connectivity to SAP Integration Suite. If you are not interested in the configuration you will use a **pre-configured *Cloud Integration* service** and jump directly to [Exercise 2 - Monitoring a deployment exception](/exercises/ex2/README.md)

## Exercise steps

Run through the steps in the given order

1. [Register a Cloud Integration service in LMS](/exercises/ex1/ex11/)
2. [Add an HTTP endpoint to a managed service](/exercises/ex1/ex12/)
3. [Activate data collection for the use case Integration & Exception Monitoring](/exercises/ex1/ex13/)

   For *Health Monitoring* the data collection is activated automatically after the creation of the HTTP endpoint

## Summary

You've now set up an **own-managed *Cloud Integration* service** in LMS with a secure connection to a Cloud Integration tenant in SAP Integration Suite. The service covers all three monitoring use cases integration, exception, and health monitoring.

Next we will get experience with an integration flow that cannot be deployed. Continue to - [Exercise 2 - Monitoring a deployment exception](/exercises/ex2/README.md)

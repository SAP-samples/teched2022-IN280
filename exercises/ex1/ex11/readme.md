# Register a Cloud Integration service in LMS

   >(Should we create the service upfront?
    >
    > Usually, your cloud services are imported from the System Landscape Information Service (SLIS). As we are not in a customer landscape, we have to add the cloud service to the Landscape Management Service (LMS). 
    >
    > As SAP Integration Suite has to be pulled for monitoring information from SAP Cloud ALM and this set up isnâ€™t configured by default the instance has to be registered manually.


In this exercise, you will learn how to register a Cloud Integration instance in Landscape Management Service (LMS.

    As a result you to get *user* and *password* for the login in to **SAP Integration Suite** as well as for **SAP Cloud ALM**. 

    Additionally the Tenant Booker app provides you all relevant roles necessary to run the hands-on session *IN280*.

    While performing the exercises please ignore *Client ID* and *Client Secret*. This info is related to other TechEd sessions that use the *Tenant Booker application*, too.

    Regarding the second URL *Tenant URL for SAP Cloud Integration*, we will leverage this URL without `/itspaces/` during the exercise [Add an HTTP endpoint to a managed service](/exercises/ex1/ex12).

    Best practice is to keep the browser tab open for accessing *user/password* assigned to you.

    Return back to your last exercise.

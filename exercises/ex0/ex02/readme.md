# Retrieve user / password

1. Go to the *Tenant Booker application* (link will be added directly before the hands-on session will start)

    <br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/BookerApp.png)

    As a result you get *user* and *password* for the logins to **SAP Integration Suite** as well as for **SAP Cloud ALM**
    
    Please recognize the SAP Integration Suite tenant assigned to you. We have one SAP Cloud ALM tenant and **six SAP Integration Suite tenants prepared (US01, US02, EU01, EU02, APJ01, APJ02)** and the *Tenant Booker application* assigns you to own of them. The URL to the assign tenant is available in the result list of the *Tenant Booker app*, the first link.

    Additionally the Tenant Booker app provides you all relevant roles necessary to run the exercises
    
    For some exercise steps, you have to ensure that the technical IDs that you will create are unique. Hence, take the digital numbers of your `user ID`

    While performing the exercises please ignore *Client ID* and *Client Secret*. This info is related to other TechEd sessions that use the *Tenant Booker application*, too.

    Regarding the second URL *Tenant URL for SAP Cloud Integration*, we will leverage this URL without `/itspaces/` during the exercise [Add an HTTP endpoint to a managed service](/exercises/ex1/ex12).

    :warning: **Best practice is to keep the browser tab open for accessing *user/password* assigned to you**

    Return back to your last exercise using the *browser back*

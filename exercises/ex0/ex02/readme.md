Please recognize and use the SAP Integration Suite tenant that is assigned to you and keep it noted for the entire session. </br>
Check your **tenant_name**, it should be one of the 6 **SAP Integration Suite** tenant as mentioned in the [System landscape](/exercises/ex0)</br>
The example screenshot shows a tenant `TECHED-US01`.

### Systems

- [*SAP Cloud ALM* tenant](https://teched22-cloudalm-003.eu10.alm.cloud.sap/launchpad#Shell-home)
- *SAP Integration Suite* tenant: First link in the *Tenant Booker app*

### Additional hints for [Exercise 1.2](/exercises/ex1/ex12)

- Please ignore *Client ID* and *Client Secret* credentials and use only the API credentials
- Use the second link *Tenant URL for SAP Cloud Integration* as *Root URL* but without `/itspaces/` at the end

**Note:** Best practice is to keep the browser tab open for accessing the *username, password* and other *tenant details* that is assigned to you.

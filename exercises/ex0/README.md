# System landscape

The tenants we use for this IN280 virtual workshop are pre-configured. 

<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/RegisteredServicesToSuiteTenants.png)   

We have **one** *SAP Cloud ALM* tenant and **six** *SAP Integration Suite* tenants prepared, two in three regions:

- TECHED-US01 and TECHED-US02
- TECHED-EU01 and TECHED-EU02
- TECHED-APJ01 and TECHED-APJ02

They are all running in Cloud Foundry environment

To differentiate the real **Cloud Integration tenants** of SAP Integration Suite from the representatives in SAP Cloud ALM, we call the ones in SAP Cloud ALM **Cloud Integration services**

The configuration we have done already in the SAP BTP cockpit is outlined in **[Configurations done in SAP Integration Suite subaccounts as a prerequisite for this session](/exercises/ex0/ex01/)**.

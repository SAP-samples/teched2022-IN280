# Prerequisites and additional information

The tenants we use for this IN280 virtual hands-on session are pre-configured. 

### System landscape

We have **one** *SAP Cloud ALM* tenant and **six** *SAP Integration Suite* tenants (all running in Cloud Foundry environment) prepared, two in three regions:

- TECHED-US01
- TECHED-US02
- TECHED-EU01
- TECHED-EU02
- TECHED-APJ01
- TECHED-APJ02

To differentiate the real **Cloud Integration tenants** of SAP Integration Suite from the representatives in SAP Cloud ALM, we call the ones in SAP Cloud ALM **Cloud Integration services*.

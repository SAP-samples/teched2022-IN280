# System landscape

The tenants we use for this IN280 virtual workshop are pre-configured. 

We have **one** *SAP Cloud ALM* tenant and **six** *SAP Integration Suite* tenants prepared, two in three regions:

- TECHED-US01
- TECHED-US02
- TECHED-EU01
- TECHED-EU02
- TECHED-APJ01
- TECHED-APJ02

They are all running in Cloud Foundry environment

To differentiate the real **Cloud Integration tenants** of SAP Integration Suite from the representatives in SAP Cloud ALM, we call the ones in SAP Cloud ALM **Cloud Integration services**
